# Bay Area Quarter Life
> Hand-drawn comics poking fun at quarter life crises and living in Silicon Valley.

"Bay Area Quarter Life" is a webcomic released from late 2012 to early 2013 that used to live at bayareaquarterlife.tumblr.com. On 2013-05-01, the author posted the following:

> I will be closing down this comic in two weeks. I appreciate you all for reading!

...and it was taken down some time after. Thankfully, [archive.org](https://archive.org) saved a copy of several of the pages (including an RSS feed), which were used to find the ids of the images still on Tumblr's servers. Below is, what I beleve to be, a complete (or nearly complete) reconstruction of the comic.
