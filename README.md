# Bay Area Quarter Life
> Hand-drawn comics poking fun at quarter life crises and living in Silicon Valley.

"Bay Area Quarter Life" is a webcomic released from late 2012 to early 2013 that used to live at bayareaquarterlife.tumblr.com. On 2013-05-01, the author posted the following:

> I will be closing down this comic in two weeks. I appreciate you all for reading!

...and it was taken down some time after. Thankfully, [archive.org](https://archive.org) saved a copy of several of the pages (including an RSS feed), which were used to find the ids of the images still on Tumblr's servers. Below is, what I beleve to be, a complete (or nearly complete) reconstruction of the comic.

It's interesting how your style evolves to fit in with the prevailing culture of where you spend most of your time. The college outfit should resonate with anyone who went to college on the East Coast. I can't speak for the West Coast but I imagine it involves less layering.
